By Main Menu: click ```SublimeApex > Apex Test > Run Test```, choose the test class and press enter, check the progress in the status bar until succeed message appeared, and then a new view with the test result will be open.\r\n+ 2. By Context Menu: in the context of opened class, click ```SublimeApex > Run Test Class```, check the progress in the status bar until succeed message appeared, and then a new view with the test result will be open.\r\n\r\n## View Code Coverage\r\nThis feature just works when api version is >= 29.0\r\nIn the context menu of open class or trigger, click ```SublimeApex > View Code Coverage``` in the context menu, ait for the end of the progress on the status bar, you will see the code coverage percentage in the console and a new view with not covered highlight lines.\r\n\r\n## Refresh Folder\r\nClick the folder in the side bar, refresh that you want to refresh, if you choose the classes folder, the ```Refresh ApexClass``` command will be visible, ```ApexTrigger```, ```ApexComponent```, ```ApexPage``` and ```StaticResource``` is same.\r\n\r\n## Salesforce Document Quick Reference\r\nI forked this idea from [Salesforce Referencee](https://github.com/Oblongmana/sublime-salesforce-reference) and added some feature based on it.\r\n\r\nClick the ```SublimeApex > Reference > Reload Salesforce Reference``` in the main menu, wait for a moment until the ```Open Document``` command is enabled, at this moment, you can press ```Ctrl+Shift+O``` or Click it to invoke the ```Open Document``` command, nearly all reference api will be shown in the list, you can try to choose any one and it will be opened in browser.\r\n\r\n## Refresh Multiply Components\r\nChoose the components you want to refresh, and then Click ```SublimeApex > Refresh Selected Components``` in the Sidebar Menu\r\n\r\n## Delete Multiply Components\r\nChoose the components you want to delete, and then Click ```SublimeApex > Delete Selected Components``` in the Sidebar Menu\r\n\r\n## Quick Goto Component\r\nPut the focus in the Class Name, and then, press ```shift```,  and click ```button1``` for twice, the class file will be open in background if this class file is exist, however, if you want to open this class in the foreground, you should press ```shift``` and click ```button1``` for triple.\r\n\r\n## Retrieve All Metadata\r\nClick ```SublimeApex > Retrieve Metadata``` in the main menu, you will see a new open view with message, this view will be refreshed every five seconds, after the retrieve status is completed, plug-in will download the base64 zipfile, after that, base64 zipfile will be decoded to zip file, at the last, this zip file will be extracted.\r\n\r\n## Deploy Metadata\r\nThis functionality is not perfect now, but it can work now.\r\n\r\n## Export Workflow Rules\r\nAfter you downloaded all metadata by clicking ```SublimeApex > Migration > Retrieve Metadata```, you can click ```SublimeApex > Export > Export Workflow``` to backup all workflows in your org to csv.\r\n\r\n## Export Validation Rules\r\nAfter you downloaded all metadata by clicking ```SublimeApex > Migration > Retrieve Metadata```, you can click ```SublimeApex > Export > Export Validation Rule``` to backup all validation rules in your org to csv.\r\n\r\n## Export CustomFields\r\nYou can click ```SublimeApex > Export > Export CustomFields``` to export all custom fields in your org to csv.\r\n\r\n## Export Workbook of sobjects\r\nYou can click ```SublimeApex > Export > Export Workbook``` to export all sobject workbooks in your org to csv.\r\nIf you just want to export some attributes of sobject workbook, you can do it by setting workbook_field_describe_columns in ```SublimeApex > Settings > Setting - User.\r\n\r\n## Export Available Picklist Values of Record Type\r\nYou can click ```SublimeApex > Describe > Describe Layout``` to export the available picklist values of RecordType\r\n\r\n## Exceute Rest Test\r\nUp to now, support Head, Get, Post, Delete and Retrieve Body Methods, for example, Input ```/sobjects/Account/Describe``` and click ```SublimeApex> Execute Rest Test``` in the context menu or press ```F9```, context dynamic menu will show up, you can choose GET to retrieve Account Describe Result in the new view.\r\n\r\n## Export Data Template\r\nClick ```SublimeApex > Export > Export Data Template```, wait for a moment, choose the record type of sobject, the sobject data template by record type will be exported\r\n\r\n## Bulk Api\r\n+ Up to now, support export, insert, update and delete.\r\n+ You can set the batch size and batch bytes for every batch by put ```maximum_batch_size``` and ```maximum_batch_bytes``` in your user settings, you should be aware, maximum records of single batch is **10K** and maximum bytes of single batch is **1000K**\r\n+ This tool will get your CSV file encoding type by detecting the first **1000** bytes of the CSV file, as a best practice, you should prepare CSV file which encoding type is ```ANSI``` or ```UTF-8```.\r\n+ If you want to insert a CSV file, you'd better open the CSV file in sublime and copy the file path, after you choose the sobject that you want to insert records, this tool will automatically get the file path from the clipboard\r\n\r\n## Proxy\r\nRefer to [Request Proxies](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies)\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n# Configuration #\r\n## Settings - Completions\r\nWith these settings, after we input characters described in below, sublime will automatically show the completions after character.\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n    // Auto completion after these characters\r\n    \"auto_complete_triggers\": [{\r\n        \"characters\": \".<=\",\r\n        \"selector\": \"source.java\"\r\n    }, {\r\n        \"characters\": \"<: =\",\r\n        \"selector\": \"text.html - source\"\r\n    }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## SublimeApex Settings - Default\r\nBecause you can't edit the default setting, however, if you want to change these settings, you should open ```SublimeApex > Settings > Setting - User``` and put all your change here.\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n\r\n    // Indicate whether add project name time suffix\r\n    // When this setting value is true, you create a new project at yestoday and you refresh \r\n    // it's code today, a new project folder will be created to keep the refreshed code\r\n    // Two methods to fix this bug:\r\n    //     1.

Every time when we refresh all apex code from server, the sobject field completions will be initiated at the same time.\r\n\r\n2. When we want to execute anonymous or query, we must choose any valid snippet in sublime and click the command.\r\n\r\n3. Actually, retrieve all just retrieve sobject and workflow metadata, because this process is largely time-consuming.\r\n\r\n4. Before we want to export validation rule or workflow, we must retrieve all, because we export the validation rule and workflow by parsing the metadata file.\r\n\r\n5. Every time we save the apex code, your local copy will be put into project/history path every minute.\r\n\r\n6. If we have two classes, the first one of which is the utility class for the second one, it would be best to open the first class so that we can see the variable completions when we edit the first one.\r\n\r\n7. When we want to run test, basically, your test result should be displayed as a new view.\r\n\r\n8. If we want to refresh the folder, we just need to click the SublimeApex > Refresh Folder and then choose the folder we want to refresh.\r\n\r\n9. Before we update plugin, we should move your customized settings from \"Settings - Default\" to \"Settings - User\"\r\n\r\n10. Every time when you create a new view, it's default syntax is Apex.\r\n\r\n11. If you don't want to keep the local history change, you can set keep_local_change_history to false in the settings.\r\n\r\n12. If you want to output the session info, you can set output_session_info to true in the settings.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
