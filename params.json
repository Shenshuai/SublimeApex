you can install this plugin by searching ```Salesforce IDE``` in package control\r\n\r\n# Project Configuration #\r\nIf your operation system is **OSX**, you must set the workspace in ```SublimeApex``` > ```Setting``` > ```Setting - User```.\r\n\r\nThere is a default test org in this plugin, you can see it by clicking ```SublimeApex``` > ```Switch Project``` in the main menu, however, if you want to use this plugin in your own org, you need to configure your org user confidential before new project\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent plugin update overriding your settings, you should keep your customize settings into ```Setting - User``` by clicking ```SublimeApex``` > ```Settings``` > ```Setting - User```.\r\nre\r\nYou can setup your projects follow below sample by clicking ```SublimeApex``` > ```Settings``` > ```Setting - User``` in the main menu, projects must be included in {}.\r\n\r\nWhen you initiate your settings, you can have more than one project in
